# Retrospective-Infertility-Analysis-on-ICSI-Dataset

In order to attain successful ART for infertility patients, there is a need to identify women with a high risk of producing poor response to stimulation and who have a very low probability of becoming pregnant as well as those who still have the ability to produce enough oocytes with good quality even if her age is advanced.

The serum AMH level is a reliable biomarker for ovarian reserve (the number of oocytes present). By measuring the AMH level we can predict the chances of successful pregnancy. Also, AMH serves as a diagnostic and prognostic tool for PCOS (Polycystic ovarian syndrome) patients.

The AFC count is also a major predictor of the ovarian reserve and could reflect the size of the remaining primordial follicle pool. Low fertility is characterized by low numbers of oocytes and are usually associated with high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels.

To maintain a patient’s confident level and satisfaction, creating expectation is very important. These tests which are performed in this study would help the clinicians have better predictions and they can make adjustments in the gonadotropin dosage thereby preventing ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. These predictions may also supplement the presently available tests of ovarian reserve.

# Problem Statement
The prime objective of this project is to perform a retrospective analysis using biostatistical tools and determine the relation between Anti mullerian hormone level, Antral Follicle count, and the number of oocytes in ICSI patients. Also, to determine the relationship between Anti mullerian hormone level and Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome.

# Data Collection
This retrospective study includes 97 women aged 20–45 years old referred to ICSI treatment in Vamsam infertility clinic, Shree Shiva Hospital, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu from January 2016 to December 2018. Data collected from the patient’s medical record included age, weight, AMH, FSH, E2, LH, AFC, and clinical record included causes of infertility, number of previous pregnancies, number of oocytes punctured, number of oocytes retrieved, number of oocytes fertilized, pregnancy outcome and cancellation of cycle.
